//Normally you retrieve the file download url from calling the web service core_course_get_contents()
//However to be quick to demonstrate the download call,
//you are going to retrieve the file download url manually:
//1- In Moodle, create a forum with an attachement
//2- look at the attachement link url, and copy everything after http://YOURMOODLE/pluginfile.php
//   into the above variable
